REACTIVISION-CALIBRATION
------------------------

Performs a four-points calibration for the fiducials used in the Reactivision framework (http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/). This code works for Processing 2.x.

I have been frustrated for a while with the calibration procedure provided in reactivision. Here is a simpler approach.

Procedure:
1) You need to have the reactivision library installed in your folder
2) Launch the script; position a fiducial on the target located on top left corner of the screen; press 'c'
3) repeat for each corner of the screen

The position of your tags should now be properly calibrated. Use the functions tx(tobj) and ty(tobj) in your code to get the correct coordinates.


NOTE: I reused the code provided by Matthew Venn in the processing forum to calibrate a wiimote.
